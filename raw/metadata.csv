The song was recorded in January 1946 by Louis Jordan & His Tympany Five and released by Decca Records. The record was one of Jordan's biggest ever hits with both black and white audiences, peaking at number seven on the national chart[1] and provided an important link between blues and country music, foreshadowing the development of ""rock and roll"" a few years later. Although ""Choo Choo Ch'Boogie"" is now seen as epitomising the style known as jump blues, it was written by white songwriters whose background was in country and western music.","Louis Jordan & His Tympany Five: Louis Jordan, vocal & alto sax; Jesse Simpkins, bass; Eddie Boyd, drums; Carl Hogan, guitar; Wild Bill Davis, piano; Josh Jackson, tenor sax; Aaron Izenhall, trumpet",,,1946,Decca,"That Chick's Too Young To Fry / Choo Choo Ch'Boogie, Decca 23610",,,,,That Chick's Too Young To Fry / Choo Choo Ch'Boogie,ChooChooChBoogie,@Decca1946ChooChooChBoogie @WikiLouisJordan @WikiChooChooChBoogie @WikiTympanyFive

It was considered by many Republicans to be anti-capitalist propaganda, and almost dropped from the show; attempts were made to ban it from the radio. The song became best known, however, through recordings by Bing Crosby and Rudy Vallée – both of whom were themselves Republicans – that were released right before Franklin Delano Roosevelt's election to the presidency on November 8.
